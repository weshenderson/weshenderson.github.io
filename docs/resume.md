I am a community oriented Linux nerd with more than a decade of IT experience and a penchant for automation and mentoring. I believe that continuous improvement, both in process and tech, is paramount for any organization.<br><br>The key to maintaining continuous improvement is to build and maintain a strong team through constant, organic training. This promotes knowledge sharing and helps the team adapt to changing workplace priorities.
